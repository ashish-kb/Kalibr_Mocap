# MOCAP stuff 
# mocap software running to read mocap positions check config directory for setting
roslaunch mocap_optitrack mocap.launch 

# x2 broadcast mocaps position over wifi 
open project 5N_.ttp(there is a backup of this file too)
go to motive and view and check data streaming, and change ip and select broadcast computer's address press enter to select

# x3 read mocap positions  quad nd tags, some confis in "px4_mocap_config.yaml "
# connect pixhawk ttyACM to usb_hub and tyUSB0 to the same hub
roslaunch mavros_extras px4_mocap.launch 
# needed by mavros to fake gps(for some reason it was already showing gps without running this)
rosrun tf_stamped stamped_tf 
# visualize all these in rviz nd check what is world map






# 
# Kalibr, april, flea3 stuff
# run mavros to capture px4 data pose data 
# run flea to run camera
#     read apriltags data
# y2 to run kalibr transformation to get apriltag wrt px4 center
#
# camera_base used older one from 14.04, flea3 installed from source use flycap2 to see if that can get the image
# I had to change usb port 3 times
source ./softwares/flea3/flea_ros/devel/setup.bash 
roslaunch flea3 single_node.launch device:=15291221

# goto https://github.com/personalrobotics/apriltags and do as they say
# compile from scratch because makefile downloads some stuff from online that doesn't work otherwise
# something changed about downloading from source now it requires a different folder to be cloned (https://github.com/personalrobotics/apriltags-cpp) 
#  details given here https://github.com/personalrobotics/apriltags/issues/28
# installed libcgal-qt5-dev was giving some error otherwise
# pkg_search_module(OPENCV REQUIRED opencv>=2.3 opencv-2.3.1 opencv-3.1.0-dev)
#gedit ../src/Geometry.cpp and #include <map>
#include <opencv2/highgui.hpp>
#include <opencv2/calib3d.hpp> 


# get the right apriltags.launch from odroid that uses bigger tags  nd get the 16h5ps also
# change the topic and camera_info in the launch file
roslaunch apriltags apriltags.launch
